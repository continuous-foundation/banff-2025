title: Guiding Personas for Continuous Science
subtitle: Understanding the needs, challenges, and motivations of six key groups shaping scientific communication and collaboration.
---

To imagine a future of continuous, inclusive, and collaborative science, we need more than technical fixes—we need empathy for the people who inhabit the system. That’s why we developed six core personas representing the key groups who produce, support, fund, publish, and ultimately consume scientific knowledge. These personas—[Researchers](#researchers), [Institutions](#institutions), [Tools & Infrastructure](#infrastructure), [Journals, Societies & Preprint Servers](#journals), [Funders](#funders), and the [Public](#public)—help us understand the goals they’re working toward, the frustrations they face, and the contexts they operate in. By designing with these real-world needs in mind, we can ensure that solutions aren't just visionary—they’re usable, adoptable, and rooted in how science actually gets done.

To deepen our understanding of these six groups, in the Banff 2025 workshop we created named, narrative-based personas that reflect the complexity, motivations, and needs of real people in the system. These aren’t generic archetypes—they’re grounded composites that help us empathize, challenge assumptions, and design with specificity. By giving each persona a [name and backstory](#researchers-alive), we move from abstract categories to lived experience, helping us see not just the roles people play, but what drives them, frustrates them, and gives their work meaning.
