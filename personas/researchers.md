title: Individual Researchers / Research Groups
---

(researchers-intro)=
Individual researchers are at the forefront of scientific discovery. Researchers commonly work towards
scientific discoveries together. They share funding to research and publish their work as a collective. They
often need streamlined tools to publish and share their findings effectively.

```{card} 🧍🏻Profile
- Primarily engaged in extensive research projects
- Often affiliated with universities or research institutions
- Regularly publish findings in academic journals (1-2 annually as an individual, 2-10 as a group, 5-10 in draft)
```

```{card} 🎯 Goals
- Excel in their field
- Publish research efficiently and broadly
- Enhance the impact and reach of their work
- Showcase their contribution
- Integrate data and findings seamlessly into publications
- Secure future funding or tenure for Lead
```

```{card} 😞 Frustrations
- Lengthy, complex and limited control in traditional publication processes
- Collaboration across multiple tools is challenging
- Shift to researcher paying for publishing (openly)
- Difficulty in making research accessible to wider audiences
- Lack of interactive elements in current publishing platforms limits exposure of the breadth, depth and impact of their results
```

```{card} 💚 Preferences
- Tools that simplify complex processes
- Platforms that support interactive content
- Solutions that are compatible with existing research workflows, tooling and specific datasets
- Understanding the impact of their work
```

```{card} 💭 Behavioral Considerations
- Highly detail-oriented and methodical
- Frequent need for collaboration and feedback
- Varying opinions on the adoption of new tools–some will be keen, while others will be reluctant to disrupt established workflows
```

```{card} 📍 Where to Find
- Academic conferences and symposiums
- Open Access (OA) journal submissions
- Other research journals, publications and preprint services
- University and institutional networks
