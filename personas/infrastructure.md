title: Infrastructure & Toolmakers
---

(infrastructure-intro)=
Tools and infrastructure developers design and maintain the underlying systems that power modern
science — from data repositories and publishing platforms to analysis pipelines and identity services. Their
work enables reproducibility, collaboration, and the long-term preservation of research. Often invisible to
end-users, these teams form the backbone of the research ecosystem.
