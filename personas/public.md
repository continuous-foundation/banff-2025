## Bringing the Persona to Life

The general public interprets and reshapes scientific information as they encounter it in news stories, classrooms, workplaces, and daily life. While often indirect participants in the research process, they play a vital role in how science is trusted, applied, and communicated. Their questions, needs, and lived experiences help frame what science is for—and who it serves.
