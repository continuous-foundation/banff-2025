  title: A Case Study on Curb Cuts & Sidewalks
  subtitle: How the Disability Rights Movement Transformed Public Space for Everyone
  description: |
    In the 1970s and '80s, disability advocates fought for curb cutsâ€”small ramps on sidewalks that allowed wheelchair users safe passage.
    Once implemented, these seemingly niche accommodations transformed public spaces for everyone: parents with strollers, delivery workers, travelers, and runners alike.
    The big idea is simple: when we design for the margins, we create systems that are more inclusive, resilient, and beneficial for all.
