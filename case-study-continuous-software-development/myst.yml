  title: A Case Study on Continuous Software Development
  subtitle: How Agile and Lean Principles Reshaped How We Build, Collaborate, and Deliver
  description: |
    The transition from rigid waterfall methods to Agile and continuous software development reshaped how software is built.
    Inspired by lean manufacturing, developers introduced small, incremental changes, automated testing, and continuous integration,
    unlocking massive improvements in delivery speed, quality, and team collaboration.
    The key takeaway: change isn’t a disruption, it’s a constant to be designed for—by adopting iterative, continuous practices,
    we can accelerate progress while maintaining rigor and resilience.
