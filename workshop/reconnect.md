Six weeks after the transformative Banff workshop, the workshop participants came back together to reflect on progress and chart the path forward for the composable science movement.

## Key Updates & New Initiatives

A few weeks after the workshop we released a teaser video on the composable science movement. We have also launched four initiatives based on the workshop:

- **Storytelling Hub**: Launching to highlight real stories of modular, composable science in action
- **Three Working Groups**: Modular peer review, technical standards/interoperability, and reuse incentives.

## Stories from the Field

Participants shared experiences pitching composable science:

- **Society Journals**: Editors excited about sharing beyond PDFs, brainstorming new approaches
- **Impact Stories**: Resolving tensions around ownership in open source communities
- **Foundation Interest**: Major funders exploring alternatives to traditional publishing models
- **Language Matters**: Finding the right framing has been transformative for partnerships

## The "Fit" of Composable Science

> In your conversations with colleagues, partners, or community members, what aspects of Composable Science feel natural and resonate? Where does the ‘fit’ feel awkward or unclear?

### What Resonates

- "You're already doing this" messaging
- Positioning as "next step in open science tooling"
- Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 licensing for reuse

### Where It Gets Stuck

- Infrastructure gaps for discoverability
- Confusion with existing open science practices
- Career concerns and traditional metrics
- Privacy and data sharing limitations

## Envisioning 2037

> Imagine it’s 2037: Composable Science has gone mainstream and is transforming how research is done, shared, and reused across every field. What weird, wonderful, or unexpected changes do you see in how scientists work, collaborate, or even argue?

Participants imagined a future where:

- Conferences become working sessions rather than "marketing" presentations
- Real-time sharing replaces years-old presentations
- Incentives shift to reward early sharing
- Psychological safety enables continuous collaboration

## Key Takeaways

1. **Framing matters**: Position as evolution, not revolution
2. **Build on existing workflows**: Help people see current work fits
3. **Address infrastructure**: Create systems for discoverability
4. **Align incentives**: Shift rewards to encourage early sharing
