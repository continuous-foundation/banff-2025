title: Day 2
subtitle: Story, Strategy, and Activation
---

Day 2 focused on translating the vision of composable science into clear values, narratives, and value propositions. We began with [Neanderthal poetry](./poetry.md) a playful exercise that used simple language to distill complex ideas, surfacing foundational themes like reuse, recognition, transparency, and collaboration. These themes carried into our [ad-lib value proposition exercise](./value-proposition.md), where participants crafted statements linking specific audiences with actionable benefitsâ€”helping shift the conversation from ideals to real-world relevance. A [values exercise](./values.md) further grounded the group in shared principles like openness over control and empowerment over suppression. In the afternoon, participants wrote [Story Spines](./story-spines.md), tracing transformations in science from closed, siloed systems to collaborative, modular, and iterative practices. These stories brought emotional clarity to the movement, painting a future where science is faster, more inclusive, and more useful to society. We closed the day with rapid-fire pitches that demonstrated how these ideas could take shape in real-world tools, labs, and policiesâ€”marking a shift from inspiration to activation.

An exercise to distill the purpose of composable science into clear, actionable statements. Using a simple fill-in-the-blank format, participants identified specific users, needs, and outcomesâ€”clarifying who this movement is for and what it makes possible.
