To ground our big ideas in simplicity and creativity, we used a playful exercise we called Neanderthal poetry. The idea was to take the complex, often jargon-filled language of "composable science" and break it down into its simplest, clearest terms—language that anyone could understand. But this exercise wasn’t just for fun (it was though!). It revealed the core principles of what we’re trying to build: a scientific ecosystem that is accessible, collaborative, and adaptable.

The poems brought out essential values like **reuse and remixing—science** as small, modular pieces (the **bits**) that others can easily build upon. They highlighted the importance of **recognition and attribution**, making sure that credit is clear and contributions are visible. Themes of **transparency and trust** emerged, with a collective desire for open systems where work can be verified and skepticism can be addressed. The poetry emphasized real **collaboration** means making it easy for anyone to join, contribute, and build on the work.

There was a strong undercurrent of **iteration and evolution**, showing how progress often comes from trying, learning, and improving over time. And importantly, the poems injected a sense of playfulness and fun—reminding us that the future of science communication doesn’t have to be dry or bureaucratic; it can be **energizing, creative, and joyful**.

> Split ideas in parts, make it quick. Share with all to help us learn. Run the code, track the choice, mix them up to help us learn. Put in graph, meet new friends to help us learn.

Here are a few snippets that captured the spirit of the exercise [@poetry]:

- "Peeps make small bits of work—a pic, chart or code. Each bit is made to be used and built on by other peeps."
- "We have bit. She have bit. They have bit. I have bit; me use bit from him. She used bit from me. They used bit from her. One bit good. Two bit great. Lots of bits."
- "Break down each piece we know. Share with all friends. Mix and build new tales. All give help and praise."
- "Split ideas in parts, make it quick. Share with all to help us learn. Run the code, track the choice, mix them up to help us learn."

Through these simple, punchy lines, we surfaced the both values and core concepts of the movement we are building together.

```{list-table #poetry} Neanderthal Poetry on Composable Science from the participants.
* - Peeps make small bits of work - a pic, chart or code. Each bit is made to be used and built on by other peeps. Each bit can stand on its own or mix with other bits to tell a full tale. It is fun and for the team of peeps.
* - More sci in nodes to share. We build to move fast for best life and health.
* - They all now know that you did the work.
* - Faster ship, read bit by bit. All can play. Good for me, good for you. No bad job, job just done. All is seen, fun to do. Build more, go far.
* - Split ideas in parts, make it quick. Share with all to help us learn. Run the code, track the choice, mix them up to help us learn. Put in graph, meet new friends to help us learn.
* - Do more good, more fast, with more friends; fast facts that stack. Help us know more and make good things for your health.
* - I know where to find any bit. I can make new from all. Any or mix bits and give. Find, mix and give.
* - folks no trust us.
* - Break down each piece we know. Share with all friends. Mix and build new tales. All give help and praise.
* - Bite sized bits to share. Make folk learn the world.
* - Break work down to core bits. Each bit gets checked by peers. You can use mix or build on them. Teams can write as one.
* - Use more and find core part now. Code live more. Share tool and share name. Mix and share best think.
* - We mix bits and bricks. We use bits and bricks. More fast, more fun, more know.
* - We have bit. She have bit. They have bit. I have bit; me use bit from him. She used bit from me. They used bit from her. One bit good. Two bit great. Lots of bits.
* - Please use my small work. \
    As a part of your big work. \
    A team can do more.[^haiku]
* - Read too long. Write too long. Work too long.
* - Need small stuff. Need mix stuff.
* - Me win when we win.
* - All of us move when all us win.
* - Make all parts of our stuff have a place to live and a code to share with the world.
* - Work a week. Know more. Share. Not work. Know other work. next week. Know other work this week not next year. Talk starts. Share more. Work is how to, bits and graphs, its tale.
* - Large bit made up of lots of small bits. Small bits from lab to read and use. One can look and tell if good or bad. One can choose to like or not like, use or not use, build on or trash. Share bits with ease with likes to get more looks. I write bit, you know I did.

[^haiku]: One constraint wasn’t enough so I tried to make mine a haiku!
