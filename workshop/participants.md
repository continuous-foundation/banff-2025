He is also the cofounder of the Discourse Graphs Project, which builds systems and plugins that enable researchers to track, exchange, and attribute discrete research results within and between research labs.

Matthew Feickert
: Matthew is a research scientist in experimental high energy physics and data science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Data Science Institute. He works as a member of the ATLAS collaboration on searches for physics beyond the standard model with experiments performed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. He also serves on the executive board of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) where he is a researcher and the Analysis Systems Area lead. His research has also lead to a strong focus on analysis reproducibility to leverage analysis reuse.

Michele Avissar-Whiting
: Michele is the Director of Open Science Strategy at HHMI, overseeing the Open Access Policy and a new initiative focused on research communication. Prior to joining HHMI as a program officer in 2022, she held various roles at Research Square Company, serving as Editor in Chief of their preprint platform from 2020 to 2022. She earned a PhD in Medical Science from Brown University, where she studied the epigenetic mechanisms of carcinogenesis associated with environmental exposures.

Nokome Bentley
: Nokome is a scientist and software developer with a focus on open science and research reproducibility. He is the founder of Stencila, an open-source platform aimed at supporting the creation of reproducible, data-driven research documents. His current focus is on making the use of AI in open science both more effective and transparent.

Rachel Lauer
: Rachel’s research explores the dynamic relationship between marine life and the ocean–earth interface. As a submarine hydrogeologist, Rachel uses numerical models to simulate and quantify fluid movement beneath the oceanic crust, with a focus on how seamounts connect the ocean to its permeable crust. Most recently, Rachel played a key role in an international collaboration with biologists, policy researchers, artists, and others to investigate how fluid exchange supports life 3.5 kilometres below the ocean surface off the coast of Costa Rica. This work led to a TEDxCalgary talk, which was featured as an Editor’s Choice in 2024.

Taylor Gibson
: Taylor leads the Data Science and AI programs at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, a public, residential high school in North Carolina, that's part of the University of North Carolina system.
