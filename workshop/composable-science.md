The workshop generated [multiple ideas](./future-possibilities.md) on the future places where we could invest and coordinate a movement. We voted and settled on **Composable Science**.

Composable Science aims to shift from the traditional "article economy" to a system built on modular, granular scientific contributions (e.g., individual figures, results, or code snippets). Each module is:

- **Independently** reviewed and published as a component or “snackable” research output (e.g. a figure, multiple figures, an idea, hypothesis, claim, or notebook).
- **Recomposable** into new analyses, papers, or theories—even by researchers outside the original team.
- **Transparent** and open, enabling faster, reusable, and iterative scientific progress.
- **Creditable** to all contributors, not just the lead authors.

This model breaks from the current linear publishing system, embracing a networked, decentralized ecosystem of scientific knowledge. It supports multiple contributors, facilitates remixing, and aligns with modern collaboration, team based science and transparency values.

### Opportunities

Rapid dissemination and iteration
: Smaller units mean faster sharing of findings, earlier feedback, and quicker impact.

Lower barriers for contribution
: Even students or early-career researchers can contribute to modular outputs, democratizing access to scientific publishing.

Enhanced reuse and remixing
: Individual figures or results can be reused across multiple contexts and narratives, making science more efficient and impactful.

Granular expertise in peer review
: Reviewers can focus on smaller, specialized components, improving quality and reducing bottlenecks.

Transparent contribution and credit
: Acknowledges diverse roles (e.g., data curation, code, visualization) and enables modular recognition.

Potential to disrupt traditional publishing models
: Shifts incentives and control from journals toward researchers and funders, with reuse as core values.

Alignment with modern collaboration models
: Mirrors approaches in design systems, modular software, and the early web, fostering resilience and creativity.

### Challenges

Technical infrastructure
: Requires new systems to manage modular outputs, assign DOIs, track provenance, and ensure interoperability.

Context and provenance tracking
: Needs robust metadata standards to maintain context and trace contributions across compositions.

Cultural shift
: Overcoming entrenched norms about publication, authorship, and reuse may meet resistance in academia and publishing.

Incentives and recognition
: Current systems reward complete articles and high-impact journals; transitioning to modular credit systems requires funder and institutional buy-in.

Risk of hijacking by traditional publishers
: Large publishers might co-opt the system, embedding modularity into paywalls or subscription models.

Scalability of peer review
: Modular review increases the number of items needing review, demanding streamlined processes and incentives for reviewers.

Community readiness
: While some labs already use modular approaches, broader adoption will need significant education, trust-building, and demonstration projects.
