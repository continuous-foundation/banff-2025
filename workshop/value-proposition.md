title: Value Proposition

+++ {"label": "value-prop-intro"}

After grounding ourselves in shared purpose through the [poetry exercise](./poetry.md), we shifted gears to explore how to clearly communicate the value of the ideas emerging in the room. Using a simple fill-in-the-blank structure, we crafted focused statements that captured who composable science is for, what it enables, and why it matters:

> COMPOSABLE SCIENCE helps (someone) who needs (something) by (action you provide) so that (an outcome can happen).

This exercise challenged us to move from broad ideals to clear, actionable use cases. While some early attempts drifted toward vague or overly grand outcomes—“so that the world can thrive”—others began to point toward concrete, compelling use cases. Key themes included: enabling teams to work more iteratively and transparently; creating creditable, reusable artifacts that support career advancement; and allowing researchers to remix and repurpose prior work to accelerate discovery. Several propositions also recognized the needs of **resource-constrained researchers**, **contributors who lack formal authorship**, and **funders or leaders seeking to scale innovation ecosystems**. The strongest statements focused on **actionable value**—such as faster collaboration, better attribution, and more effective knowledge transfer—anchored in real-world scientific challenges.

> Composable science helps researchers and contributors who need to collaborate, get credit, and build on prior work by exposing, structuring, and sharing modular research components so that science becomes more iterative, inclusive, impactful, reproducible, and faster.

## Value Propositions

- Composable science helps researchers who need to work faster and more iteratively by exposing the components of their work so that they can find, remix and reuse them in other stories.
- Composable science helps scientists iterate quickly by making openness and reuse the default so that scientists can focus on the discovery.
- My modular science paradigm helps innovators and researchers who need to rapidly share research and collaborate by opening up all components of scientific works so that science is an iterative process that rapidly evolves research and innovation ecosystems. (for Leaders & Funders)
- Modular science helps researchers work faster more iteratively and with clearer recognition by exposing the components of their work so that they can find, remix and reuse them to building something bigger for public good.
- Composable science helps researchers who need to work as a team by communicating continuously so that collectively we make faster, better discoveries.
- Composable science helps resource constrained researchers who need to communicate evidence-based recommendations by allowing them to build customized narratives from existing work so they can effectively communicate their findings to make a real world impact.
- Composable science helps research contributors who need to build on past work and share their results by creating citable artifacts to advance their careers and global science.

## Value Propositions (Individuals)

- Composable science helps research contributors who need credit for their work by being able to create reusable, citable, artifacts so that they can progress in their career.
- Composable science helps researchers who need to build on past work and share their results by enabling reuse and reducing boilerplate that science flows freely around the world with attribution.
- Composable Science helps society build a better world by helping researchers share new ideas and knowledge with everyone.
- Composable Science helps scientists who need to do science openly by making openness and reuse the default so that scientists can focus on discovery for the benefit of society
- My Modular Science Paradigm helps researchers who need to collaborate by opening up all components of scientific works so that they can be re-evolved and built upon.
- Our Method of open Science helps the scientific community who need research social motivation by giving credit to all aspects so that the world can thrive
- Modular science helps innovators and researchers who need rapid, attributable, sharing of research by enabling a modular/publication opportunity so that research output can be quickly shared and incorporated into future studies and innovation ecosystems.
- Composable science helps researchers who need recognition of their work by working structured & fast so their knowledge gets out into the world for public benefit.
- Composable science helps society build a better world by helping researchers share knowledge with everyone.
