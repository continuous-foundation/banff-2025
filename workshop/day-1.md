title: Day 1
subtitle: Setting the Context, Building the Core, Designing the Movement
---

On the first day of the workshop we set context, introduced each other, created personas, went through the pre-workshop survey results, used the iceberg model to go deep into the mindsets and systems behind events, ideated a preferable future and chose a movement together.

## Case Studies as Touchstones

Before diving into the work of reimagining scientific communication, we grounded ourselves with two powerful case studies. These stories from seemingly unrelated fields—urban design and software development—offered clear, compelling examples of how system-wide change often starts from the margins and requires focused changes on systems or mindsets. By reflecting on curb cuts and continuous software development, we set the stage for imagining how similar principles could reshape the ways we share and build science.

In the 1970s and '80s, disability advocates fought for curb cuts—small ramps on sidewalks that allowed wheelchair users safe passage. Once implemented, these seemingly niche accommodations transformed public spaces for everyone: parents with strollers, delivery workers, travelers, and runners alike. The big idea is simple: when we design for the margins, we create systems that are more inclusive, resilient, and beneficial for all.

The transition from rigid waterfall methods to Agile and continuous software development reshaped how software is built. Inspired by lean manufacturing, developers introduced small, incremental changes, automated testing, and continuous integration, unlocking massive improvements in delivery speed, quality, and team collaboration. The key takeaway: change isn’t a disruption, it’s a constant to be designed for—by adopting iterative, continuous practices, we can accelerate progress while maintaining rigor and resilience.

These case studies served as **touchstones** throughout the workshop, reminding us that meaningful change often begins at the edges—with overlooked users, or outdated processes—and grows through intentional, iterative design. They helped frame our collective work: identifying the small, strategic shifts that could unlock a more inclusive, flexible, and future-ready system of scientific communication.

## Personas

After grounding ourselves in the case studies, we turned our attention to the diverse ecosystem of stakeholders shaping scientific communication. To build a more inclusive, impactful, and resilient system, we needed to understand the needs, challenges, and aspirations of everyone involved. We co-developed six key personas—representing [researchers](xref:personas#researchers), [institutions](xref:personas#institutions), [infrastructure providers](xref:personas#infrastructure), [journals, societies & preprint servers](xref:personas#journals), [funders](xref:personas#funders), and the [public](xref:personas#public).

## Pre-Survey Results

The overall _vibe_ of the survey was _partly sunny with a chance of "well actually..."_. There were many bright spots but definitely some cloud cover hanging around. There’s optimism, but also stretches of frustration and fatigue that dim the brightness.

## Reframing the Challenges

After the presentation of the pre-meeting survey with the summaries of tensions, we had a group discussion on reframing what often feel like intractable challenges. Participants discussed the complex, often conflicting forces shaping today’s scientific communication system. Despite working with good intentions, many actors—researchers, funders, publishers, institutions—find themselves trapped in a system that reinforces individualism, competition, and outdated norms. The conversation surfaced a shared recognition that incentives—whether shaped by prestige, funding, or career advancement—are misaligned with the collaborative and transparent behaviors we want to see in science.

Early in the discussion, participants acknowledged the presence of what some called "gravity problems"—fundamental forces like capitalism, the tenure system, or entrenched economic models that are difficult or impossible to change directly within the scope of this room. Like gravity, these forces shape everything, but railing against them doesn't make them go away. Instead of getting stuck trying to "solve" these immutable constraints, the conversation shifted to more actionable ground: how to **reframe norms** (preprint-ing is now **norm**alized, and is only now being fully incentivized), build **new practices**, and develop tools and infrastructure that can **influence behavior** at the community and institutional levels.

Participants emphasized that norms—social behaviors reinforced by shared expectations—are often as powerful as incentives, and often can be more malleable. Shame and prestige were discussed as dual forces that can either uphold harmful traditions or be redirected to accelerate positive change. There was a strong call to move away from shame-driven open science advocacy and toward rewarding, inspiring norms—ones that make it desirable, not obligatory, to share, collaborate, and reuse.

The group also identified critical pain points where new infrastructure or coordination tools could have outsized impact: the over-reliance on longform journal articles for credit, the invisibility of modular contributions, and the lack of shared language around what counts as meaningful participation. These are areas where small shifts—new publishing formats, attribution systems, or lab-based communication practices—could make local norms visible and scalable.

Finally, a recurring theme was the power of **local action**: communities with shared values can lead by example, creating new defaults that ripple outward. Change may not come from dismantling everything at once, but from finding opportunities where motivation and capability align—places where new norms can take root, new infrastructure can support them, and new stories about science can begin to spread.

## Lunch

Before lunch on the first day, we set context went through participant introductions, created personas to guide the conversations, went through the pre-survey reflection, reframed the challenges and discussed some of the things we _didn't_ want to talk about, and then created our Icebergs. We pushed people pretty hard.

We aligned at a high-level opportunity to focus our energy and movement around: "Composable Science". We then went to the top of Sulphur Mountain to have dinner, go on a walk — and start to try the movement of _composable science_ on for size.

## Reflections from Day 1: Clarity, Challenge, and Collective Potential

At the end of Day 1, participants shared reflections on the ideas, energy, and challenges that emerged. They were "super impressed by the Jason and Courtney’s facilitation" and "applaud the organizers for such a compelling meeting".

> I learned a lot, and I feel (even more) excited (radicalized?) about open science.

A clear theme was the desire to leave the workshop with **concrete actions**—not just visionary thinking. “Our goals shouldn’t be timid,” one participant noted, “but they should also be realistic and within our control.” Others emphasized the importance of staying focused on what we can influence, rather than getting stuck on systemic forces and "gravity problems".

Many appreciated the depth and honesty in the conversations—even when the conversations got uncomfortable, we moved through it as a group. “It was refreshing to go beyond surface-level discussions,” one person shared, “especially when people shared their personal experiences.” There was a strong sense that norms, not just policies, are what need to shift—and that creating local spaces for new behaviors, new forms of credit, and reusable outputs could be a viable way forward.

The idea of _composable science_ surfaced repeatedly as a potential cornerstone for this shift. There was still some heavy skepticism around the concept—especially around use cases, how peer-review might work, and that the concept wasn't fully articulated. However, many participants described _composable science_ as “concrete and achievable,” with the potential to “enable real-time collaboration, improve attribution, and bring new contributors into research.” One participant captured the mood well:

> Composable Science, convergently articulated by multiple people today, has the hallmarks of the **beginning of a movement**.
